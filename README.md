# Archiva

Archiva is a revolutionary platform leveraging Aptos technology, Move language and advanced cryptographic techniques, and machine learning to automate the archival and permanent-archival of smart contracts. By integrating cutting-edge tools like Chainlink Oracles, IPFS or Arweave for secure storage, zk-SNARKs for verification, and an AI-powered Flag Prediction model, Archiva ensures enhanced data privacy, regulatory compliance, and user-friendly interaction for decentralized applications (dApps).

## Key Features

- **Automated Smart Contract Archival and Permanent-Archival**
Automates the lifecycle of smart contracts, including archival and permanent archival processes, ensuring efficient management.

- **Secure Storage**
Utilizes IPFS for decentralized and tamper-proof storage of archived contract data.

- **Privacy-Enhanced Verification**
zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge) for verifying data without revealing sensitive details.

- **Machine Learning Model for Flag Prediction**
A supervised learning model predicts whether a smart contract should be archived or permanently archived based on features like usage patterns, contract activity, and custom criteria.

- **Real-Time Data Integration**
Chainlink Oracles enable dynamic interaction with real-world data and conditions, triggering smart contract operations based on predefined criteria.

- **Regulatory Compliance**
Ensures adherence to data protection and privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, integrating customizable retention and archival policies.

- **User-Friendly Interface**
Intuitive dashboards for contract management, policy configuration, and real-time monitoring of archival processes.

## Architecture Overview

**1. Blockchain**
Utilizes Aptos for smart contract execution and state management.

**2. Decentralized Storage**
IPFS for file integrity and content-based addressing.

**3. Chainlink Oracles**
Provides trusted, real-time external data feeds to trigger archival or permanent-archival events.

**4. zk-SNARKs**
Integrated for secure, privacy-preserving verification during contract archival and data permanent-archival.

**5. AI-Powered Flag Prediction Model**

**Model Type:** Supervised learning (Ensembled model with employed Majority Voting Rule - Decision Tree, Random Forest, XG Boost)
**Inputs:** Smart contract activity logs, usage metrics, and predefined criteria.
**Outputs:** Binary prediction (Archive or Permanent-Archive).

## Technical Workflow:

**Step - 1: Smart Contract Creation** - Users deploy contracts with metadata and rules for archival or permanent-archival.

**Step - 2: Monitoring and Event Trigger** - Chainlink Oracles monitor conditions such as time, usage metrics, or custom triggers defined by users.

**Step - 3: Archival Process** - Contract data is compressed and stored on IPFS. Metadata is recorded on the blockchain for transparency.

**Step - 4: Flag Prediction Using ML Model** - The ML model analyzes contract activity and usage patterns to predict the appropriate mode (Archive or Permanent-Archive).

**Step - 5: Permanent-Archival**
Smart contracts trigger permanent-archival when predefined conditions or ML predictions are met, ensuring compliance and resource optimization.

**Step - 6: Verification with zk-SNARKs**
Ensures compliance without revealing sensitive data to third parties.
